# Block Breaker

Block Breaker is a type of game where there is a bouncing ball, some set of blocks and a paddle. The ball is used to break the blocks and the paddle is used to bounce the ball. The blocks gets destroyed when the ball touches them. The task is to destroy as many blocks as possible without losing the ball. 

Meanwhile, there might be some suprises you can get in the form of powerups. The role of powerups is to generate a new ball. 

I hope the game is clear now.

## Legends
1. **BALL** : It is used to break the blocks. It's the only tool by which you are survived in the game.
2. **PADDLE** : It is used to bounce the ball, per se to give the ball another chance to break the blocks and help you score.
3. **BLOCK** : These are your enemies. Just destroy as many as you can till you have atleast one ball left.
4. **POWERUPS** : *When a door closes another opens.* - brace this age old saying. But in modern times, sometimes you might get multiple doors to open for life and sometimes you won't find any. Well this is a powerup which will be produced randomly and hence can help you turn them into one ball per powerup.
